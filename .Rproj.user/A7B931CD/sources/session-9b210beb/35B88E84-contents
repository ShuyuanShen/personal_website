::: {#hero-heading}

I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 

I am broadly interested in political communication, information and communications technology (ICT), and public opinion in authoritarian regimes. 

My current projects explore the effect of propaganda and censorship in autocracies with computational and experimental methods.
