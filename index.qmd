::: {#hero-heading}

Shuyuan Shen is a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science and a Master's student in Statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His research lies at the intersection of comparative politics and international relations, with a particular focus on Chinese domestic and global politics, comparative political communication, and political economy. He employs a range of advanced methodologies in his research, including computational, experimental, and statistical techniques. Shuyuan's work has been published in *International Studies Quarterly* and *World Development*.
  
His dissertation “What About Abroad: How Chinese Media Leverages Foreign News for Distraction and Legitimization” leverages social media and experimental data and demonstrates that autocrats strategically mobilize negative foreign news to distract public attention away from domestic problems, thereby minimizing the loss of legitimacy and maintaining regime support during crises. This research expands the authoritarian politics literature by highlighting the role of negative foreign news as a crucial distraction tool and demonstrating how coverage of international politics and affairs influences domestic support in autocracies.
