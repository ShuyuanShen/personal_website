Shuyuan Shen is an incoming Assistant Professor of Political Science and International Relations at Loyola Marymount University. He received his Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His research sits at the intersection of comparative politics and international relations, with a focus on Chinese domestic and global politics, comparative political communication, and political economy. His work has been published in *International Studies Quarterly* and *World Development*.
  
<!-- Shuyuan's dissertation, *Whataboutism with Foreign Affairs: How Chinese Media Leverages -->
<!-- Foreign News for Distraction and Legitimization,* draws on large-scale social media data and original experiments to examine how Chinese state media strategically use negative foreign news to divert public attention from domestic issues and reinforce regime support. By highlighting foreign news as a key instrument of distraction and legitimation, the project contributes to the study of authoritarian resilience and media politics, demonstrating how coverage of international affairs can shape domestic public opinion under authoritarian rule. -->
