    "text": "Course: Introduction to Chinese Politics\nThis course offers an introduction to the politics of contemporary China (PRC). China is the world’s second-largest economy after the United States, accounting for just under 18 percent of global GDP. It has the second largest military budget in the world as of 2023, and it is one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. It is hard to overestimate the political, economic, and military impacts of China in the current world order. However, China contrasts sharply with liberal democracies particularly with its authoritarian political system, or what the Chinese Community Party (CCP) calls the “whole-process people’s democracy”. How does the Chinese political system work? What are the key institutions in the system? What is the policy- and decision-making process? How do civil societies and ordinary citizens evaluate and interact with the system? Is the Chinese political model sustainable or doomed to fail? What can other countries in the world learn from the Chinese political model? Throughout this journey, we’ll tackle these burning questions. The main goal of this course is to introduce students to the most crucial aspects of the Chinese political ecosystem, exploring how institutions, civic societies, and ordinary citizens co-exist, sustain, or challenge the system.\n\n\n\nCreator: TINGSHU WANG | Credit & Copyright: REUTERS\n\n\nRequest Course Syllabus"
